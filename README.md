# mullvad-fast
This is a simple script to find the fastest mullvad vpn server by ping response.

Please note I am in no way affiliated with mullvad I just wanted to have a way to find the fastest server and existing solutions only worked on Linux and Mac.

Due to the nature of this script it likely won't work on anything but Widnows.  I may at some point update the script to support other operating systems but in the mean time please check out the other projects people have made.
